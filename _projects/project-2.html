<h2>üí¨ Toxic Comment Classification</h2>

<p>In today's digital age, online communication has become a vital part of our lives. However, with the increasing volume of online interactions, there is a growing concern about the presence of toxic and harmful comments. This project, <strong>Toxic Comment Classification</strong>, aims to tackle this issue using advanced machine learning techniques.</p>

<h3>üöÄ Project Overview</h3>

<p>This project is a <strong>machine learning initiative</strong> focused on developing a robust system capable of identifying and classifying toxic comments. The main goal is to create a safer and more welcoming online environment by automatically filtering out inappropriate and offensive content.</p>

<h3>üîç Key Features & Techniques</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Deep Learning Architecture</strong>: We employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with a bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. This hybrid architecture allows for efficient feature extraction and contextual understanding of comments.</li>
  <li><strong>Text Preprocessing</strong>: Before feeding the data into the model, we performed extensive text preprocessing, including tokenization, removal of stop words, and word embedding using techniques like Word2Vec or GloVe.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-class Classification</strong>: The model is trained to classify comments into multiple categories of toxicity, such as hate speech, profanity, and personal attacks.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Evaluation</strong>: We utilized metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying toxic comments.</li>
</ul>

<h3>üíº Applications & Implications</h3>

<p>The <strong>Toxic Comment Classification</strong> system has practical applications in various online platforms, including social media, forums, and blogs. By integrating this system, these platforms can automatically detect and filter toxic comments, thereby promoting healthy and constructive conversations.</p>

<h3>üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Programming Language</strong>: Python</li>
  <li><strong>Deep Learning Framework</strong>: TensorFlow / Keras</li>
  <li><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>: NLTK, SpaCy</li>
  <li><strong>Data Visualization</strong>: Matplotlib, Seaborn</li>
</ul>

<p>This project showcases the power of deep learning in natural language processing and its potential to create positive changes in online communities. By leveraging advanced techniques, we can build systems that not only understand the context of conversations but also actively contribute to making the internet a safer place for everyone.</p>
