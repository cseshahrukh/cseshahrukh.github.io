## 🌈 Programming For Kids

Welcome to **Programming For Kids**, an innovative and interactive learning platform specifically designed to make programming accessible and fun for children. This project was developed as part of my Level 4 Term 1 software development course, and it embodies my passion for education and technology.

### 🎯 Project Overview

**Programming For Kids** aims to introduce young learners to the world of coding through a series of carefully curated lessons and hands-on activities. The platform offers a child-friendly interface and a variety of features to enhance the learning experience:

- **📚 Sequential Weekly Lessons**: Kids can progress through weekly modules that cover fundamental programming concepts. Each lesson builds on the previous one, ensuring a smooth and logical progression.

- **📝 Exams & Challenges**: To reinforce learning, the platform includes assessments in the form of multiple-choice questions and programming problems. These challenges help solidify the concepts taught in each lesson.

- **💡 Hints & Assistance**: We understand that learning can sometimes be challenging. That's why we've integrated a hint system that provides guidance if students get stuck on a problem. This encourages perseverance and problem-solving skills.

- **🔮 AI-Driven Recommendations**: The platform features an intelligent recommendation system powered by AI. It suggests courses and topics based on the child's progress and interests, ensuring a personalized learning experience.

### 💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), the platform boasts a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: The server-side logic is handled by [Flask](https://flask.pallets.com/), providing a robust and scalable backend.
- **Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is used for data storage, ensuring reliable and efficient management of user data and content.

### 🎨 Why It Stands Out

This project is not just about teaching coding; it's about making learning an enjoyable journey. By leveraging modern technologies and thoughtful design, **Programming For Kids** provides an engaging educational experience that can inspire the next generation of programmers.
